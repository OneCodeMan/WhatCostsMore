A game where two products are displayed and you have to guess which one costs more.

I made this to get familiar with JQuery and Bootstrap, and to learn SASS and Gulp.
I also made this to show how surprisingly pricey certain things are, such as MTG cards. 
It's mindblowing how furniture can cost less than an MTG card... Seriously.
